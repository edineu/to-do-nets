# FE Assignment 

### to-do-nets App

## Build a new create-react-app project from scratch

You choose if you want to do the classic Todo-app, or something else. The functionality is up to you, but should at least contain:

- CSS styling that resembles the styling on our site nets.dk/en/payments. Use Styled component for styling. (https://styled-components.com)

- A login (just fake a login function with a promise) - it should ideally validate the input fields.

- At least two more pages with routing for going back and forth between them.

- Client-side state handling, where you get and set relevant values. You can either use a data storage library, roll your own solution, or use the bare minimum.
      Folder: App.js
      Line 15 - 20 

      â€¢ A custom hook. It could be something with data fetching, scroll restoration, or whatever you like.
        // For Hooks I have use useState
        // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call later
            const [inputText, setInputText] = useState("");

It would be nice with a couple of notes about how you approached the problem (bottom-up or top-down, and so on).

It should be timeboxed to about 3 - 4 hours, so don't go crazy, but simply be ready to explain your approach to anything you did not complete.
